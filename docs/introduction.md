Welcome to the **Neo4j Performance Guide**!  

Neo4j is a powerful graph data platform, but one of the platform's core components is the **graph database**. Learning and exploring the database can be fun, but you can sometimes run into some wired performance or scale issues. 
This guide contains tips and tricks on how to combat these issues. 

This guide is here to serve a community as helpful content on the Neo4j journey. This guide contains quick tips and tricks for performance tunning and question-answers that can help you when you run into performance or scale bottlenecks. 
If you wish to contribute to this website, feel free to open an issue or pull a request on [Github Repo](https://github.com/dtomicevic/neo4jperf-guide). 

If you want to avoid performance and scale issues altogether, you can always check [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/), a graph computation platform for streaming data with a high-performance C++ database.
